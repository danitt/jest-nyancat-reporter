# jest-nyancat-reporter

TypeScript port of https://github.com/philihp/jest-nyancat-reporter

Also contains all the development environment bells and whistles from https://github.com/danitt/ts-boilerplate


## Future Work
- improve reporter feedback, as the kitty tends to be rather quiet in the initial test aggregation phase, leading nervous developers to wonder if it's frozen..
